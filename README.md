## üè† Traditional On-Premises Security vs Cloud Security

1. **Location** ‚Äì Cloud security hosts data and applications in off-site data centers managed by cloud providers, whereas on-premises security relies on the organization‚Äôs own local servers and infrastructure.  
2. **Responsibility** ‚Äì In the cloud, the provider secures the infrastructure and physical environment, while the customer secures configurations, applications, and data; in on-premises setups, the organization is fully responsible for securing all aspects of the environment.  
3. **Scalability** ‚Äì Cloud environments offer elastic scalability that allows resources to expand or shrink on demand, while on-premises environments require manual provisioning of hardware, which is costly and slow.  
4. **Maintenance & Updates** ‚Äì Cloud providers manage infrastructure maintenance, patching, and updates, whereas on-premises environments require the organization to handle all system maintenance and software updates themselves.  
5. **Cost Model** ‚Äì Cloud uses an OpEx model with pay-as-you-go flexibility and minimal upfront costs, while on-premises infrastructure follows a CapEx model with significant initial investment and ongoing operational expenses.

## ü§ù Google Cloud Trust Principles

1. **You own your data, not Google**  
   ‚Äì You can access, export, delete, and manage your data and its permissions at any time.  

2. **Google does not sell customer data to third parties**  
   ‚Äì Your data is never sold or monetized for marketing or advertising purposes.  

3. **Google Cloud does not use customer data for advertising**  
   ‚Äì Customer data is not used to build advertising profiles or serve targeted ads.  

4. **All customer data is encrypted by default**  
   ‚Äì Data is automatically encrypted at rest and in transit to protect confidentiality and integrity.  

5. **We guard against insider access to your data**  
   ‚Äì Strict access controls and monitoring are in place to prevent unauthorized employee access.  

6. **We never give any government entity "backdoor" access**  
   ‚Äì Google only provides data when legally required and does not build hidden access paths.  

7. **Our privacy practices are audited against international standards**  
   ‚Äì Google undergoes independent audits to validate compliance with global data protection regulations.

## üåê Data Sovereignty & Data Residency

- **Data sovereignty** means data is subject to the laws of the country where it resides, ensuring compliance with regulations like the EU‚Äôs GDPR.  
- **Data residency** refers to the physical location where data is stored or processed, often mandated to stay within a country‚Äôs borders. **Google Cloud supports data residency** by allowing you to choose specific regions (e.g., Germany, Finland) where your data will remain.

**Organization Policy and IAM settings** prevent accidental storage in unauthorized regions.

**VPC Service Controls** restrict access to data through defined network perimeters.

**Google Cloud Armor** adds protection by filtering traffic for external load balancer based on geographic origin.

These controls **work together** in layered defense:

- **Org Policy** (what‚Äôs allowed) ‚Üí **IAM** (who can access) ‚Üí **VPC SC & Cloud Armor** (network boundaries)

This layered approach is essential for **compliance, zero-trust security, and preventing data breaches**.
